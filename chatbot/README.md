The chatbot is still in development... the instructions will change later.

# Basic instructions:
1. Go to https://pixmap.fun/chat .
2. Open console by inspecting element, right-click anywhere and inspect element or use a shortcut command.
3. Copy bot.js and paste and run on console (the script can be changed how you want if needed).
4. Run any command on console.

# Console commands:
- **sendmsg("your message")**: Sends a singoular message.
- **startbot()**: Starts bot from the function included in script (can be changed as you want)
- **stopbot()**: Stops ditto.
- **startspam(milliseconds, "your message", antimute?)**: Type ms as number (reccomended: 1500-2000ms or more to not get muted), and for antimute type "true" or "false" (adds Antimute at end with random number to avoid mute).
- **stopspam()**: Stops ditto.

# Functions:
- The bot doesn't spam if the chatbox isn't empty, so you can talk withouth your message getting whipped off when bot sends message.
